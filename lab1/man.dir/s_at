              expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their  descriptions  matching
              each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with apropos(1) --wildcard.  The
              page argument must match the entire name or description, or match  on  word  bound‚Äê
              aries  in  the  description.   Since  there  is usually no reasonable way to pick a
              "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is  used,  match  only  page  names,  not  page
              descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.
              Using this option forces man to display all the manual pages with names that  match
              the search criteria.
