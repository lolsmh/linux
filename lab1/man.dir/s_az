       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward com‚Äê
              patibility,  encoding may be an nroff device such as ascii, latin1, or utf8 as well
              as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that
              do  not  contain  hyphens,  if  it is necessary to do so to lay out words on a line
              without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic  hyphenation,  so  words
              will only be hyphenated if they already contain hyphens.

              If  you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating
              a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option,  but  consult  the  nroff
              documentation  instead;  for  instance,  you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate
