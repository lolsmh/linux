       The manual pager utilities packaged as man-db make extensive use of index database caches.
       These caches contain information such as where each  manual  page  can  be  found  on  the
       filesystem  and what its whatis (short one line description of the man page) contains, and
       allow man to run faster than if it had to search the filesystem  each  time  to  find  the
       appropriate  manual  page.   If  requested  using  the -u option, man will ensure that the
       caches remain consistent, which can obviate the need to manually run  software  to  update
       traditional whatis text databases.

       If  man  cannot find a mandb initiated index database for a particular manual page hierar‚Äê
       chy, it will still search for the requested manual pages, although file globbing  will  be
       necessary to search within that hierarchy.  If whatis or apropos fails to find an index it
