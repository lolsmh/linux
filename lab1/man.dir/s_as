              above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages
              having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case

              each page argument as a regular expression, as with  apropos(1).   Since  there  is
