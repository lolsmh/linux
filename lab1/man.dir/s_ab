       man [-?V]

DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of
       a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with each of  these  arguments
       is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that
       section of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the  available  sections
       following  a  pre-defined  order ("1 1p 8 2 3 3p 4 5 6 7 9 0p n l p o 1x 2x 3x 4x 5x 6x 7x
       8x" by default, unless overridden by the SECTION directive in  /etc/man_db.conf),  and  to
       show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The  table  below  shows  the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages
       they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
