       Exact  rendering  may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually
       not be able to render italics when running in a terminal, and will  typically  use  under‐

       tions.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive  invocations  as  is
       shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.
