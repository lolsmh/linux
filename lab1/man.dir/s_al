f letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting  pipeline  is  formed  from  the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or
       [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable  program  mandb_nfmt  (or
       mandb_tfmt  with  -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed
       the manual source file, the preprocessor string, and optionally the device specified  with
       -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non  argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both,
       are not harmful.  For options that require an argument, each duplication will override the
       previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
