              is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced  by
              a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced by a colon (:).

              argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to
