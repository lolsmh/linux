              you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you  to  convert
              several  manual  pages  to a single encoding without having to explicitly state the
              encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure  similar
              to a manual page hierarchy.

              $LC_MESSAGES  and  $LANG.   To  temporarily override the determined value, use this
              option to supply a locale string directly to man.   Note  that  it  will  not  take

              will always be displayed in
