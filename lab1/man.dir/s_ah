       of .Z, .z and .gz.  It is possible to deal with any compression extension, but this infor‐
       mation must be known at compile time.  Also, by default, any cat pages produced  are  com‐

       /usr/X11R6/man may have any directory as its cat page hierarchy.   Traditionally  the  cat
       pages  are stored under the same hierarchy as the man pages, but for reasons such as those
       specified in the File Hierarchy Standard (FHS), it may be better to store them  elsewhere.
