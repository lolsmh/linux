       this preformatted file is (usually) decompressed and then displayed, via use of  a  pager.
       The  pager  can  be  specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default is
       used (see option -P for details).  If no cat is found or is older than the nroff file, the
       nroff is filtered through various programs and is shown immediately.

       If a cat file can be produced (a relative cat directory exists and has appropriate permis‐
       sions), man will compress and store the cat file in the background.

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option  -p  or
       the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p was not used and the environ‐
       ment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor
       string.  To contain a valid preprocessor string, the first line must resemble
